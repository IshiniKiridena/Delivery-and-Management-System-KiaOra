In this evolving world, most people are running a race against time, even the 
uncomplicated tasks like shopping have become hectic compared to early times. 
Furthermore, with this technological revolution people tend to find effortless ways to get 
their  chores  done  in  no  time  and  some  companies  and  organizations  are  no  exception. 
They must step forward and evolve with  modern technologies to cater their customers as 
well  as  their  necessities  in  an  orderly  manner,  particularly  in  a  time  like  this  where  a 
pandemic  situation  has  made  the  world  a  technology  park.  Therefore,  by  converting 
company's  downgraded  manual  tasks  into  automated  business  processes  will  diminish 
time consuming activities and workforce by making their daily functions less challenging 
and bringing forth convenience to their clients and thus gaining a favorable outcome as a 
company. 
KiaOra  is  a  recently  established,  daily  items  delivering  company,  located  in  matale  and 
Dambulla  areas.  With  the  expansion  of  their  customer  base,  handling  items,  stocks  and 
managing  customers  and  employee's  payment  details  have  become  extremely  difficult 
tasks.  Consequently,  an  automated  system  came  forward  to  ease  the  demand.  This 
company is potentially focused on selling their items by  having personal delivery system 
as well as seasonal promotions. They have suppliers who supply items such as bulbs, rice 
cookers,  televisions  etc.  With  regards  to  the  personal  delivery  management  system,  the 
companyâ€™s delivery team  take  a  route  in  particular  area  and  sell  their  products  to  the 
people  along  the  way.  Whoever  purchase  the  items  must  pay  three  quarters  from  the 
original  price  on  the  first  day  and  will  be  given  three  months  credit  period  to  pay  the 
remaining. The salesperson will insert order details of the customer and the order. Within 
that  three  months  remaining  payments  will  be  updated  and  calculated  by  the  system.  In 
addition to that the company  has seasonal promotions where they promote and sell their 
products  in  large  scale  by  visiting  places  such  as  companies,  targeting  employees  and 
offering them discounts as well. The credit period  is as same as to the personal delivery 
customer.  Furthermore,  the  company  even  sell  items  to  number  of  shops  as  well,  where 
the  shop  owner  contacts  the  company  and  request  the  items  directly.  The  details  of  the 
shops,  owners,  and  items  required  to  be  stored  in  the  system.  Items  repairing  is  another 
phase  of  this  company.  Whether  it  is  an  item  purchased  from  them  or  not,  it  facilitates 
any  repairing  service  to  their  customers.  Overall,  this  brand-new  system  simply  assists 
the  owner  of  the  company  to  follow  any  required  information  regarding  his  customers, 
employees,  suppliers,  payments,  promotional  sales,  shops  and owners,  inventory  details, 
monthly expenditure, and the profit in an effective manner.
